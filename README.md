# multiple-timescale-dynamics-minicourse

Minicourse on multiple timescale dynamics, UMich Summer 2021. 

**Sources**: figures and examples have been cribbed shamelessly from various books and papers, including, but probably not limited to:

* _Multiple Time Scale Dynamics_ by Christian Kuehn

* _Nonlinear Oscillations, Dynamical Systems, and Bifurcations of Vector Fields_ by Guckenheimer/Holmes

* _Centre Manifolds, Normal Forms, and Elementary Bifurcations_ by Andre Vanderbauwhede -- go here if you want to see gory details of the proof of the center manifold theorem

* _Geometric singular perturbation analysis of an autocatalator model_, Gucwa and Szmolyan 2008

* Canards in $R^3$
