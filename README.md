# multiple-timescale-dynamics-minicourse

Minicourse on multiple timescale dynamics, UMich Summer 2021. 

**Sources**: figures and examples have been cribbed shamelessly from various books and papers, most significantly Christian Kuehn's excellent text _Multiple Time Scale Dynamics_. We also refer to:

* _Nonlinear Oscillations, Dynamical Systems, and Bifurcations of Vector Fields_ by Guckenheimer/Holmes

* _Centre Manifolds, Normal Forms, and Elementary Bifurcations_ by Andre Vanderbauwhede -- go here if you want to see gory details of the proof of the center manifold theorem
